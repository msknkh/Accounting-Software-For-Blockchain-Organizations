# DAO Books - DAO Accounting Tool

- DaoBooks empowers the DAO users to:
- See decoded transactions and tag them
- Its intelligent auto-tagging feature makes it such that the accountant would only have to add a few tags for 100s of transactions
- It allows them to build a fully customisable income, expense and P&L statement
- It gives them an overview of the treasury and the cash flow 
- The report can be publicly viewed by anyone but tags can only be edited by wallets nominated by the DAO
- Gnosis safe tx cost the last signee gas fees, DAOs can now track and repay their contributors their gas fees in only a three clicks
- Gnosis safe’s CSV airdrop app is widely used for making bulk transactions but it has a very poor UI, DaoBooks’ UI will blow it out of the water
- [Not yet implemented - on frontend] Facility to create and analyse Projections and checkout the taxes that the DAO owes to the state
